## Concurrency

Current immutable and unsafe-pliability behavior is defined by
[Zax qualifiers](language/qualifiers.md). Immutability addresses value change,
not lifetime, shared backing storage, synchronization, allocation, safe
transfer, or reference-count safety. The remaining concurrency mechanisms on
this page are legacy input.
Current `copy`/`deep`/`move`/`last` meaning is defined by
[Zax transfer stances](language/transfer-stances.md). Those stances do not by
themselves establish thread safety, sendability, shared-backing safety, or async
lifetime.

The retired material in this page proposed automatic `deep` propagation and
automatic `last` results for asynchronous work. Those claims are no longer
current. The unresolved question is which explicit transfer, capture, lifetime,
allocation, and synchronization contracts are required when a value crosses a
thread or suspension boundary. Representative source and deciding pressure are
preserved by [raw async input](project/raw/async.md).


### Creating asynchronous functions from captured function invocations

Using function invocation capturing and function chaining, an invocation of a function can be captured (but not called immediately). Another new function can be created to capture the results of the not yet invoked function and feed that result into another function after. This final newly minted function can be sent to a different thread to execute where the return result will invoke a callback when the function is complete.

The transfer, ownership, lifetime, and synchronization requirements of a
captured invocation crossing a thread boundary remain unresolved. This legacy
example does not establish that one stance makes the capture thread-safe.

An example of invocation capture with a later callback invoked from a different thread:

````zax
// a function that invokes a function that has no return result
invokeOnAnotherThread(funcLater :) = {
    // ...
    
    funcLater()

    // ...
}

myFunc final : (result : Integer)(value1 : Integer, value2 : String) = {
    // ...
}

then final : ()(input : Integer) = {
    // ...
}

// capture an invocation of a function (but doesn't actually call the function)
later := [] myFunc(42, "meaning of life")

// chain the output of the function to the input of the `then` function
laterThen := later | then

// send the function to a different thread to execute
invokeOnAnotherThread(laterThen)
````


### Creating asynchronous function out of `lazy` functions

A `lazy` function can be converted into an asynchronous function (see [lazy functions](lazy.md)). When a function qualified as `lazy` returns a `lazy` function, the `lazy` function can be passed and invoked from an alternative thread.

The transfer and lifetime contract for sending a deferred or lazy callable to
another thread remains future async work.

````zax
runOnThread final : ()(callable : ) = {
    // ...
    result := callable()
    // ...
}

func final : (value : Double)(algorithm : String) lazy [[asynchronous]] = {
    forever {
        // ... complex algorithm ...
        yield return value
    }
    [never]
}

later := func("sha265")

runOnThread(later)

// ...
````


### Creating asynchronous functions using `promise`

Calling a function labelled as `promise` does not invoke a direct call to a function. Instead a function pointer is returned that can be transferred and executed on another thread or queue for later execution. When a `promise` is resolved, a callback to a `then` function occurs indicating the `promise` is resolved and the results are sent to the `then` function.

````zax
myFunc final : ()(value1 : Integer) promise = {
    // ...
}

/*
TemplatedPromiseResult :: type {
    ThenCallbackPrototype :: alias type ()()

    then mutator : (callable : ()())(callback : ThenCallbackPrototype) 
}
*/

// calling laterFunc function causes all the values passed into the function to
// be captured where the function can be executed later
later := myFunc(42)

callable := later.then = {
    // called after the `myFunc` is completed with the return result
    // (called from the thread that executed the function when resolved)
}

executeCallableOnAnotherThread final : ()(callable : ()()) = {
    // ...
    callable()
    // ...
}

// `myFunc` will get executed when `callable()` is called from the other thread
executeCallableOnAnotherThread(callable)
````


#### Transfer across a `promise` boundary

Legacy material proposed automatic `deep` capture for individual parameters or
an entire `promise`. That behavior is not current. Future async work must decide
which explicit `copy`, `deep`, `move`, ownership, and lifetime contracts make a
captured value safe to use after suspension or on another thread.


#### Returning variables from an `promise` function asynchronously

A `promise` function can return arguments. The returned arguments are returned by the `promise` function and passed into a `then` function attached to the resulting structure of a `promise`. A promises result will only ever occur once. As a `then` function is set before the execution of a `promise` function, a function's results can never complete prior to a `then` function being attached to the returned `promise` type.

````zax
executeCallableOnMainThread final : ()(callable : ()()) = {
    // ...
    callable()
    // ...
}

executeCallableOnAnotherThread final : ()(callable : ()()) = {
    // ...
    callable()
    // ...
}

myFunc final : (result : String)(value1 : Integer) promise = {
    // ...
}

/*
TemplatedPromiseResult :: type {
    ThenCallbackPrototype :: alias type ()(result : String)

    then mutator : (callable : ()())(thenFunc : ThenCallbackPrototype)
}
*/

// calling laterFunc function causes all the values passed into the function to
// be captured where the function can be executed later
later := myFunc(42)

callable := later.then = {
    // called after the `myFunc` is completed with the return result
    
    resultCallbackFunc final : ()(result : String) promise = {
        // ... call back will happen on main thread ...
    }

    // pass the callable function returned from the promise into a
    // function that will execute the result back onto the main thread
    executeCallableOnMainThread(resultCallbackFunc(result).then = callable)
}

// `myFunc` will get executed when `callable()` is called from the other thread
executeCallableOnAnotherThread(callable)
````


### Using `task` to schedule asynchronous function calling

A `task` operates similar to a `promise`. The key difference is that a `task` can return data one or more times and a `task` can be scheduled and rescheduled for future processing later. A `task` can also suspend itself allowing for a `then` callback to proactively request a `task` be reactivated and continue processing. When a `task` is no longer needed, a `task`'s `cancel` function can be called to indicate a `task` should clean itself up and should only continuing scheduling itself for the purpose of final cleanup.

In the example below a generator `task` function lazily counts forever starting at `0`. When the `task` function is first executed, the `task` does not actually run but returns `producer` and `consumer` types. The `producer` type can be sent to a different thread of execution whereupon the `task` can be scheduled until completed. The `consumer` type can be used to attach a callback to receive a callback every time a result the `task` returns. The `yield` keyword operates in conjunction with the `return` keyword, except the function does not exit. Instead the `yield` causes the current values to `return` from the `then` callback and the `task` will resume. The compiler will break the `task` function into sub-functions that can be started and stopped for scheduling purposes.

````zax
// the function runs forever, which is okay for `task` functions as they can
// have their execution cancelled when they are no longer needed

/*
enum Coroutine.Status {
    Ready,
    Suspend,
    Complete
}
*/

countForever final : (result : Integer)() task = {
    /*

    Cancellation :: type {
        // ...
        cancelled mutator final : (isCancelled : Boolean)()
        // ...
    }

    // auto variable declared named `cancellation` auto-captured for tasks
    cancellation : Cancellation

    */

    // checking for cancellation after yielding is appropriate to exiting
    // a task earlier than normal completion
    while !cancellation.cancelled {
        ++result
        yield return result
    }

    // exiting without `return` is legal in a task that is cancelled
}

// ...
````


#### Using `await` to create asynchronous call chains

A `task` function can call other `task` functions easily by using the `await` keyword to obtain a single result from a called `task` method. This creates a method by which one `task` can begin executing another `task` where all the tasks will be scheduled collectively. At any time the entire chain of tasks can be cancelled where the compiler will schedule cleanup of the tasks.

````zax
scheduleTaskProducer final : ()(producer :) = {
    // ...
}

func1 final : (result : Integer)() task = {
    // ...
    return result
}

func2 final : (result : String)(input : Integer) task = {
    
    // ...
    value := await func1()
    // ...

    return result
}

func3 final : ()(input : Integer) task = {
    // ...
    value := await func2(input)
    // ...
}

myTask := func3(42)

// ... setup ...

producer := myTask.then = {
    // ...
}

scheduleTaskProducer(producer)

defer myTask.consumer.cancel()

// ...
````


#### Using `yield` `suspend` and the captured `result()`

The `yield` combined with `suspend` can be used to cause a task to intentionally sleep until externally resumed.

One caveat, if a task self-suspends itself the task will has no intrinsic method to wake itself up. Likewise, no event occurs to indicate a `suspend` has occurred. Coordinating a self-suspend and external resume is undefined and any appropriate design pattern can be used to solve this concern.

````zax
scheduleTaskProducer final : ()(producer :) = {
    // ...
}

externalThreadThatWillResumeTaskAtSomeFutureTime : ()(producer : ()()) = {
    // ...
    producer.resume()
    // ...
}

func final : (result : Integer)() task = {

    // ...

    // A vanilla yield will not suspend the task but it will cooperatively
    // yield to another task. Also `yield` allows for an external process a
    // key point in a task more ideal to perform operations like external
    // suspending or early cancellation.
    yield

    // ...

    // cause the task to `suspend` until `resume()` is called by an
    // external entity; should `resume()` be called prior to suspending the
    // task will be rescheduled immediately; multiple `resume()` calls
    // prior to suspending will only resume a single time.
    yield suspend

    // ...

    return result
}


myTask := func(42)

// ... setup ...

producer := myTask.then = {
    // ...
}

scheduleTaskProducer(myTask.producer)

// ...

externalThreadThatWillResumeTaskAtSomeFutureTime(producer)

// ...

defer myTask.cancel()
````


#### `task` cancellation

Whenever a function qualified as `task` encounters an `await` or `yield` statement, a function might perform a quick exit from the current function if the `task` is cancelled. This is done to ensure predictable `task` function exit points and to ensure `task` functions are not left in undetermined state. Function cleanup occurs as needed and the compiler can insert code to cause additional clean-up calls for any `task` scheduler as needed. If `await`, `yield` are called after a task is cancelled during the automatic cleanup, those statements will become new instant exit points in whatever routines called them.

Functions will not throw exceptions upon cancellation. Any non-constructed/non-assignment variables from an awaited function will not complete in the event of a cancellation (thus any non-constructed variables will also not be destructed in turn).

In the example below two function exit points exist in the `fetchRandomDataForever` function. The `await` can be automatically converted to a quick exit from the function if the awaited task is cancelled. The `yield` can also convert into quick exit from the function.

````zax
fetchRandomNumber final : (result : Integer)() task = {
    // ...
    return result
}

fetchRandomDataForever final : (result : Integer)() task = {
    forever {
        // the function can exit if the awaited `task` is cancelled whereupon
        // the `number` type is not constructed nor assigned a value
        number := await fetchRandomNumber()

        // the function can exit if the yielded `task` is cancelled instead of
        // producing another value whereupon the `number` is not returned from
        // the `task` but instead the `task` continues its cancellation process 
        yield return number
    }
    [[never]]
}

myTask := fetchRandomDataForever()

provider := myTask.then = {
    // ...
}

// ...

// cause the scheduled `task` to quick exit
provider.cancel()

// ...
````


#### `task` transfer

The transfer, capture, cancellation, and result contracts for `task` remain
future async work. A `task` does not acquire automatic `deep` behavior merely
because it may run on another thread.


### Using `channel` to schedule asynchronous function calling

A `channel` operates similar to a `task`. The key difference is that a `channel` can be called once or more times with additional input arguments while continuing to execute within the context of the same function call. Like a `task`, a `channel` can return data one or more times. Like a `task`, a `channel` can be scheduled and rescheduled for future processing later. A `channel` can also suspend itself allowing for a `then` function callback to proactively request the `channel` be reactivated and continue processing. Just like a task, when a `channel` is no longer needed, the `channel`'s `cancel` function can be called to indicate the `channel` should clean itself up and should only continuing scheduling itself for the purpose of final cleanup.

A `channel` function can be suspended and resumed or cancelled in exactly the same manner as a `task`, and a `channel` function can `await` a `task` function.

In the example below a generator `channel` function lazily counts forever starting at `0` and will read from the channel to reset the number at a new sequence. When the `channel` function is first executed, the `channel` function does not actually run but returns `producer` and `consumer` types after performing initial setup with a channel type passed into the `channel` function. The `producer` type can be sent to a different thread of execution whereupon the `channel` can be scheduled until completed. The `consumer` type can be used to attach a callback to receive a callback every time a result the `channel` returns. The `yield` keyword operates like the return keyword, except the function does not exit. Instead the `yield` causes the current values to be returned from the `then` callback and the `channel` will continue to run (after `activate()` is called). The compiler will break the `channel` function into sub-functions that can be started and stopped for scheduling purposes.

### Allocators and threading

When allocation is performed on the context using the standard allocator operator (`@`), the allocator will use the standard allocator (`___.allocator`) which is usually set to the sequential allocator (`___.sequential.allocator`). The sequential allocator is typically faster than the parallel allocator (`___.parallel.allocator`) as the sequential allocator only needs to allocate memory using thread unaware allocation algorithms and frees using the thread unaware algorithms.

The downside to a sequential allocator is that allocation and deallocation assume thread local heaps which can have unintended consequences. The sequential allocators do not use any thread locking mechanisms as they assume only the current thread can manipulate a thread's heap at any given time without locks. However, if one thread performs a thread heap allocation and another thread performs the deallocation then that memory needs to be reinserted into the original thread's heap (which cannot be done by another thread). In this specific case, the freed memory is inserted into a thread-safe dangling list for the original thread that performed the allocation. When the original thread wakes up and decides to examine the dangling points for that thread then the dangling memory blocks can be reinserted back into the original thread heap (which usually happens during parallel allocation of if more space is needed for the thread heap). If the originating thread has quit prior to freeing a thread heap allocation then that dangling memory should be recycled into another thread's heap when freed.

A double "at" symbol, known as the parallel allocator operator (`@@`), is a compiler shortcut to force allocation using parallel/thread-safe allocators for the types (and its contained types). When the parallel allocator operator is encountered the standard allocator is replaced by the parallel allocator temporarily for the current allocation (and reset back to the original allocation completes). An "at" symbol with a "bang", known as the sequential allocator operator (`@!`), forces the sequential allocator to be used for the type (and its contained types) by replacing the standard allocator (`___.allocator`) temporarily.

Whenever a `strong` pointer type is allocated, the standard allocator (`___.allocator`) in the context is replaced by the parallel allocator temporarily (i.e. assigned to `___.parallel.allocator`). This is done to ensure that any allocated data is entirely allocated in a thread-safe manner (and deallocated later in a thread-safe manner). Once the allocation is complete, the original standard allocator is restored allowing any future constructor and allocations of other types to use the potentially faster sequential (`___.sequential.allocator`) allocator if that allocator was previously in use.

Caution: care must be taken when transferring an allocated `own` pointer to a `strong` pointer. Pointers qualified as `unique` or `own` are allocated using the standard allocator which is typically set to the sequential allocator by default. If an `own` pointer gets transferred later into a `strong` pointer or across thread boundaries, then consider using parallel allocators.

Functions declared as `promise`, `task`, or `channel` are implicitly asynchronous. The parallel allocators are automatically substituted over the sequential allocators for a function call implicitly asynchronous or functions declared explicitly asynchronous using the `[[asynchronous]]` directive. The previous allocators are restored automatically upon exit of the asynchronous function's call.

A sequential allocator is designed to favour allocations that deallocate from the same thread for speed efficiency reasons. But memory deallocated on different threads should eventually cause dangling memory to become reintegrated into the original thread's heap (at the cost of efficiency).

The language does not enforce the rules of allocation, but instead gives tools to ensure that allocations are as optimal as possible depending on the coder's intentions.

### Context and threading

A new context instance must be set-up for any spawned thread/fiber as the context variable's (i.e. `___`) instance is tied to an individual thread/fiber. This allows the context instance to use optimized thread-unaware operations.
