# Zax programming language

Zax is a general-purpose programming language intended to provide high-level
capabilities without hiding the lower-level behavior, costs, and tradeoffs
producing them.

> **Project status:** Zax is in conceptual design. The current conceptual-design
> pages below own the accepted concerns assigned to them. The root topic pages
> remain legacy design notes being reviewed; none of this material is a formal
> specification or implementation promise.

  types, representation, conversion, arithmetic policy, counts, sizes, and
  portability.

  merging, compile-time joining, radix catalogs, and custom literal

## Legacy language-design notes

These pages preserve substantial prior design work. Their detailed syntax and
semantics remain non-authoritative until individually reviewed and promoted.

### Foundations and flow

- [Basics](basics.md) — legacy foundations; current scalar and literal design is
  owned by [Zax integers](language/integers.md),
  [literal source and operators](language/literal-source-and-operators.md), and
  [strings and characters](language/strings-and-characters.md)
- [Type definition](type-definition.md)
- [Variadic functions](variadic.md)

  conversion is owned by [Zax integers](language/integers.md), while current
  string identities and compile-time joins are owned by

  life-path and non-owning reference design
