Current general behavior has moved to
[Zax safety and analysis](../../language/safety-and-analysis.md). This file
retains the categories and comparative pressure that future safety work must
still disposition.

## Guarantee categories to investigate

- Type integrity
- Initialization
- Bounds
- Pointer validity
- Lifetime and use-after-free
- Aliasing
- Data-race boundaries
- Arithmetic behavior
- Panic behavior
- FFI and assembly trust
- Resource exhaustion
- Deadlock and starvation
- Logic and broader security correctness

The last categories may be explicit non-guarantees rather than properties the
compiler can prove.

## Construction-derived safety pressure

[Zax construction, replacement, and destruction](../../language/construction-and-destruction.md)
requires static lifecycle reasoning without mandatory runtime state flags.

Future safety work must decide which cases the language contract guarantees the
compiler will reject, including:

- use before member construction;
- use after member destruction;
- missing construction or destruction on one normal path;
- two operations affecting the same member lifetime;
- normal return with an incomplete enclosing instance;
- conflicting call-site and constructor-body member construction;
- unsafe manual lifecycle operations hidden behind opaque code;
- incomplete current-instance access; and
- publication or reentrant observation before construction completes.

Bounded helper access and publication are different:

```zax
+++ final : ()() = {
  _.first.+++()
  initializeRemaining(_)
}
```

```zax
+++ final : ()() = {
  registerGlobally(_)
}
```

The second call may retain an access path, notify subscribers, or reenter through
another path. A control that permits the first must not automatically permit the
second.

An unsafe assertion may override incomplete proof or assert the result of an
opaque operation. It cannot make known use after an ended lifetime valid, and it
cannot make any known violation valid. Detailed source-control and provenance
questions are preserved in
[raw analysis-control input](analysis-controls.md).

Zax has no declaration form that leaves storage indeterminate. Work item 032
removed `unsafe ???`. Construction performed by an opaque operation is asserted
at that operation with `unsafe<opaque-construction>{ ... }`, which also takes the
named member out of automatic construction. See
[construction by an opaque operation](../../language/construction-and-destruction.md#construction-by-an-opaque-operation).
When the compiler cannot tell whether a place is constructed, the code must be
restructured; there is no unsafe override for construction state.

## Invocation-derived safety pressure

[Zax function invocation](../../language/function-invocation.md) requires static
reasoning about:

- use before a result slot is constructed;
- incomplete or duplicate result completion;
- operations unavailable in moved-from or terminal source state;
- references returned from argument or result temporaries;
- source and destination result slots consumed more than once; and
- reentrant observation between completed earlier bindings and not-yet-bound
  later parameters.

Future safe-subset work must decide which cases the language guarantees are
rejected, which rely on a selected lifetime strategy, and which narrow unsafe
control can acknowledge an unproved but valid operation.

[Zax transfer stances](../../language/transfer-stances.md) and
[intent acknowledgements](../../language/intent-acknowledgements.md) now
distinguish:

- defined terminal-source reuse, which requires intent acknowledgement;
- an unavailable operation in terminal state, which remains invalid;
- and an unproved lifetime or alias claim, which may require unsafe
  responsibility.

Transfer implementation blame belongs at the declaration when analysis can
prove duplicate exclusive ownership, resource loss, double disposition,
incomplete destination state, or a source left unsafe to destroy. Failure to
visibly take a resource is not itself a violation; `copy`, `move`, and `last`
implementations may legally preserve more source state than their maximum
authority permits.

## Composition-derived diagnostic pressure

Current [composition](../../language/composition.md) distinguishes three
immediate outer-provenance operations. Plain `outer cast` or outer-result `via`
requires selected-contract proof and produces a non-optional result.
`tracked outer cast` or `tracked via` performs the checked optional operation
through the `outer tracked` capability. `unsafe outer cast` or `unsafe via`
asserts unproved non-optional provenance. An `intent` acknowledgement cannot
grant unsafe authority.

Future safety work must formalize the initial site-specific exact-origin proof
candidate. At one cast site, every origin that can reach the operand must be the
exact resident member path named by the target. Same-typed sibling members,
arbitrary parameters, callbacks, raw-pointer or opaque ingress, and exported
standalone-member acceptance can prevent that proof. Unrelated external values
that cannot reach the site do not.

When the selected contract requires and establishes that proof, plain
`outer cast` needs neither `outer tracked` placement metadata nor a runtime
check and produces a non-optional result. Without that proof, it is rejected
rather than silently changing result shape or mechanism. The exact mandatory
proof classes and algorithms remain future specification and implementation
work.

Required source spelling must remain portable under the selected contract:

- a mainline contract-required proof requires the safe unmarked form and makes a
  redundant `unsafe` a hard error; deliberately retaining tracked optional
  semantics requires `intent<redundant-outer-tracking>`;
- without contract-required proof, plain `outer cast` is unavailable; checked
  optional behavior requires `tracked outer cast`, while the unchecked
  non-optional form still requires `unsafe` even when one compiler privately
  proves the claim;
- a stronger compiler or shared extension may make that proof canonical only
  when source explicitly selects the extension contract; and
- a proved-false plain or unsafe claim is invalid, while the checked tracked
  operation produces absence.

Private stronger analysis may optimize or advise, but cannot silently change
mainline source validity, require a redundant-tracking intent acknowledgement,
or change the optional result shape of a tracked operation. The same matrix
applies to outer-result provenance through ordinary, `tracked`, and
`unsafe via`.

The intent category acknowledges the selected-contract-proved redundancy and
the optional tracked contract; it grants no provenance and does not force a
physical metadata read. Future proof formalization must apply it at the portable
source contract boundary rather than making it compiler-cleverness-dependent.

Future safety and diagnostic work may decide whether deliberately choosing an
unsafe form when an available `tracked outer cast` could express the same
operation should require a dedicated intent acknowledgement or advisory
diagnostic. That future policy must not make intent authorize provenance,
change the tracked form's optional result, or turn a known-false relationship
into a valid unsafe claim.

Future callable preconditions and postconditions add proof pressure:

- a precondition may let a minted body assume pointer/optional presence, a
  numeric range, collection size, ownership state, or another predicate;
- every normal exit must prove each promised result postcondition;
- callers may rely on the selected visible prototype's guarantees;
- compatible visible prototypes must not promise facts the minted
  implementation cannot establish;
- opaque but valid proof may require a narrow unsafe assertion at the operation
  that hides the fact; and
- a known violation cannot be made valid through intent acknowledgement or
  unrelated unsafe permission.

Exact contract syntax and the portable minimum proof set remain future work.

## Panic boundary

An unresolved panic is fatal graceful crashing. A matching helper may resolve a
panic only by repairing the condition while the operation that encountered it
remains blocked. That same operation then completes as though the failure had not
occurred. Otherwise the program crashes.

Resolution does not skip the failed operation, supply an unrelated substitute
result, unwind completed members, roll back construction, continue after
incomplete destruction, or expose partial lifecycle state to ordinary code.

For example, an allocation-failure helper may obtain more backing storage, extend
the arena, and let the same blocked request succeed. It cannot turn a failed
`@` allocation into a vacant pointer; source selects `@!` when that result is
wanted.

Required-result fixed-width overflow likewise cannot resume with wrapping or a
substitute result. Programs select optional, wrapping, saturating, or reporting
operators when they need another local policy.

Future panic work must define helper discovery, eligibility, recursion, helper
failure, and the exact continuation point while preserving once-only operand
evaluation and the no-partial-continuation rule.

Future safety work should test a general default-check contract across other
runtime failure domains. Where a check is required by default, violation panics.
An explicit unchecked contract may permit omitting the check and make violation
undefined, provided the cost and responsibility remain visible and reproducible.

Panic categories are independently enabled or disabled rather than controlled
as one all-or-nothing mode. Allocation has no separate unchecked operator:
disabling the allocation-failure panic category applies the general promise to
ordinary `@`, while `@!` must retain its check to report vacancy.

This does not require runtime handles for static lifetime proof. A false unsafe
optional-presence, reference-lifetime, or alias assertion may have undefined
consequences with no required check. Debug modes may add detection and panic, but
that instrumentation is not a language guarantee.

A source-program panic during compile-time execution must become a compiler
diagnostic with source and evaluation-path context rather than an internal
compiler crash. This does not imply a compile-time panic handler.

## Nothing-instance safety pressure

[Zax Nothing instances](../../language/nothing-instances.md) establishes a
vacant pointer's special target and leaves several cross-feature safety
classifications for future work:

- a proved dereference of a vacant pointer is diagnosed, while an unproved
  postfix dereference performs no universal vacancy check;
- trapping policy uses target read protection when available, but an access
  relying on unavailable hardware trapping has undefined behavior rather than
  a universal generated software check;
- access to an unreadable compiler-prepared member panics;
- a write to compiler-provided Nothing backing is invalid, may be diagnosed
  statically, traps on targets with suitable write protection, may be noticed by
  optional instrumentation, and otherwise can corrupt shared backing or have
  undefined consequences;
- a custom Nothing instance may be writable, but mutation is ordinary shared
  state with programmer-owned synchronization;
- disabling an applicable pointer-arithmetic or access check accepts narrow
  unsafe responsibility; and
- unsafe cannot bypass managed-pointer disposition or legalize a guaranteed
  leak.

Future safety work must integrate these boundaries with independently
selectable panic categories without promising one fixed proof algorithm or a
check on every store. It must keep vacant pointers, absent optionals,
unavailable function values, uninitialized storage, and ended lifetimes
distinct in diagnostics.

It must also distinguish certainty from suspicion. A compiler that proves an
invalid Nothing write may reject it. When a pointer may flow into a later
writer but invalidity is not proved, any standard unsafe responsibility likely
belongs at that handoff or call boundary rather than on the eventual store.
The provisional unsafe catalog records `possible-nothing-write` and
`possible-nothing-read-trap`; the latter applies only to built-in trapping
Nothing or a defined type selecting `= trap`.
Whether stronger non-mandatory findings use standard compiler-dependent
analysis, only language-defined cases, or `x-` extension diagnostics remains
future safety/error design.

## Unchecked versus unsafe admission

Current identity admission behavior is owned by
[Zax identity types](../../language/identity-types.md#admission). This section
retains the future safe-subset classification.

Identity work exposes a safety distinction future work must preserve:

- `optional from` validates and returns absent on rejection;
- `unchecked from` skips semantic validation but has defined mechanical behavior;
- `unsafe from` bypasses an invariant on which memory, lifetime, representation,
  concurrency, or optimizer guarantees may rely.

An unchecked document handle may be meaningless without making construction
itself undefined. A forged capability or invalid representation may require the
stronger unsafe boundary. `restricted` identity means only that automatic
ordinary admission is absent; the identity owner decides which validated,
unchecked, unsafe, or unavailable paths exist.

Future safety work must define when an invalid semantic value remains a logic
error and when it can violate the safe subset. Existing enum and endian
`unsafe from` operations need reconsideration under that distinction rather than
automatic renaming.

## Unchecked required arithmetic contract

Current programmer-visible integer contract behavior is owned by
[the integer operator catalog](../../language/integer-operator-catalog.md#unchecked-build-contracts).
This section retains its future safe-subset and auditing classification.

An explicit build policy may replace required overflow checks with the contract
that every required arithmetic result is representable. Contract-respecting code
retains the exact result. A violation has no promised behavior and may be
optimized under the assumption that it never occurs.

Future safety work must decide whether code relying on that build contract is
inside a contract-qualified safe subset, how the assumption is audited, and
which non-representability panic conditions the policy covers. Defined modular
arithmetic remains the separate wrapping operator family.

## Comparative input

Rust is a comparison point, not an opponent.

Preserve investigation of:

- the value of safe Rust's memory-safety and data-race guarantees;
- borrow-checker restrictions and ownership-oriented redesign;
- `Arc`, `Mutex`, `RefCell`, state machines, and indirection as both real costs
  and possible cognitive overhead;
- unsafe implementations in standard libraries and dependency chains;
- FFI invariants;
- deadlock, starvation, panic, resource, logic, cryptographic, authorization,
  and business-rule non-guarantees;
- C++ mitigation through RAII, ownership conventions, smart pointers,
  sanitizers, static analysis, review, and tooling;
- AI-assisted analysis as broad but probabilistic support rather than a
  deterministic guarantee; and
- CHERI-style pointer capabilities and their limits around temporal lifetime,
  concurrency, resources, and logic.

Future work must define Zax's promises first, then compare them carefully.

## Activation and retirement

Activate this residual input when a future contract assigns exact guarantees to
one of the unresolved categories above, formalizes domain diagnostics, or
performs the preserved language comparison. Move accepted details into
[Zax safety and analysis](../../language/safety-and-analysis.md) and applicable
domain owners, then retire this file.
