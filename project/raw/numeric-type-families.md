## Current finite-integer disposition

Current exact and role-selected finite integers, ranges, storage, conversion,
count tiers, signedness pairs, `delta`, `distance`, and endian eligibility are
owned by [Zax integers](../../language/integers.md). Complete protected integer
operation behavior is owned by the
[integer operator catalog](../../language/integer-operator-catalog.md); exact
forms and precedence remain in the
[general operator catalog](../../language/operator-catalog.md).

This raw input retains the generic mechanism, associated-type implementation,
custom/extreme numeric families, multiword arrangement, fixed-point, unbounded,
and floating questions. It is not a competing definition of current integers.

## Signedness counterparts

A concretely typed integer may request its equal-width opposite-signedness
counterpart:

```zax
unsignedValue : U8 = 100
signedValue := +unsignedValue // I8(100)
```

Future numeric work must decide how a custom type advertises:

- signedness;
- an equal-width counterpart;
- supported panic/optional/wrapping/saturating/reporting policies;
- generic constraints and reflection;
- layout relationships; and
- conversion versus counterpart operation.

This is one type with a signedness property or relationship, not a requirement
for separate mutable/immutable-style implementations.

## Finite and unbounded families

An arbitrary but finite type such as conceptual `I137`/`U137` can define modular
counterpart operations. A truly unbounded signed integer has no wrapping
conversion to an unbounded nonnegative counterpart without a supplied modulus.

Bit count, shift, rotate, reversal, reduction, set-bit mask, set-bit position,
multiword, and masked extraction/deposit operations all require a finite defined
logical bit extent. A runtime-sized bit vector may provide one. Hidden allocation
capacity and padding must not change results.

## Associated bit- and byte-count types

The zero-count forms and optional set-bit-position phrases share the associated
unsigned bit-count type of their operand:

```zax
leadingZeros := #<bits
position := bits trailing set bit position

if ?position
  shifted := x << position.
```

`T bit count type` must represent zero through `T`'s logical width and be directly
viable as a protected shift count for `T`. Ordinary widths select `BitCount`;
extreme widths select `LargeBitCount`. Generic code asks for the associated type
instead of branching between tiers.

`T byte count type` similarly selects `ByteCount` or `LargeByteCount` according
to the complete storage-envelope byte count.

The CPU profile chooses ordinary representations subject to language capacity
rules. Large tiers cover the language maximum:

```text
LargeBitCount: 0 through LanguageMaximumIntegerWidth
LargeByteCount: 0 through ceil(LanguageMaximumIntegerWidth / 8)
```

The initial language maximum is `2^23` logical bits, requiring at least 24
unsigned logical bits for `LargeBitCount` and at least 21 for `LargeByteCount`.
Exact tier syntax, reflection, and future larger language versions remain
numeric/generic work.

An ordinary `BitCount` has at least eight logical bits and therefore represents
at least zero through 255.

Associated-type teaching must lead with its purpose: ordinary widths use compact
counts, extreme widths use larger counts, and generic code asks `T bit count
type` rather than branching on width.

Bit-count tier selection uses logical width. Byte-count tier selection uses the
storage-envelope byte size.

## Exact, optional, and narrowing conversion

Integer conversions use declared range facts:

```zax
myWide := myU16 as U32
myOptional := myU16 as U8?
myNarrow := myU16 narrowing as U8
```

- `as Destination` is available when the type contract or a compile-time-known
  value proves exact representability;
- `as Destination?` returns absent instead of losing information;
- `narrowing as Destination` performs defined modular conversion;
- `unsafe as` is reserved for actual guarantee weakening rather than ordinary
  integer truncation.

Admission into an exposed numeric identity uses `from`, `optional from`, or
`narrowing from`. A restricted identity may instead declare validating
`optional from`, defined-but-unvalidated `unchecked from`, truly unsafe
`unsafe from`, or no representation admission.

Equal representation never creates an identity conversion. A direct bridge
requires a declared semantic relationship and a proof that every source value
fits.

Future work must provide enough range and relationship metadata for programmers
and tooling to derive the applicable surface without listing every named pair.

## Delta and distance

The aligned operation concepts are:

```zax
myDelta := myLeft delta myRight
myDistance := myLeft distance myRight
```

Both are eager, left-associative language-defined binary phrases at additive
precedence and require the same integer identity on both sides.

`delta` returns `T delta type` and represents exact `left - right`. Its selected
signed result covers `-(2^W - 1)..+(2^W - 1)`. A CPU profile may select the next
appropriate native or byte-oriented width rather than exact `W + 1`. The
operation is unavailable when no language-supported result type covers the
range, including at the maximum integer width.

`distance` returns `T distance type` and represents exact `abs(left - right)`.
Its unsigned result covers `0..2^W - 1`, so it remains available at the language
maximum.

Neither operation has wrapping, saturating, optional, reporting, compound, or
mutation forms. Pointer comparability remains pointer/lifetime work.

## Storage carrier and unusual widths

`T storage type` is the smallest byte-sized unsigned integer carrier large enough
for `T`'s complete storage envelope:

```text
I32 storage type -> U32
I57 storage type -> U64
```

It names capacity, not a safe raw conversion. A non-byte-multiple integer has
unspecified non-value storage bits that cannot affect defined numeric behavior.
Widening uses the logical sign or zero extension; narrowing uses logical bits.

An arbitrary exact width may back an ordinary enum. Endian families are limited
to whole-byte exact widths with no non-value storage bits. No language-provided
raw storage extraction exists for an unusual padded width such as `I57`.

## Identity and counterpart relationships

Exact intrinsic counterparts are derived by changing signedness at equal logical
width. Named role identities are paired relationally by the integer factory or
another validated generic mechanism; the compiler never infers a counterpart
from spelling.

One-sided roles return an unnamed exact intrinsic counterpart and intentionally
leave role identity. Restricted or opaque semantic identities receive no
counterpart merely because they use integer storage.

## Optimized maximum family

`OptimizedMaxI`/`OptimizedMaxU` preserve the widest provider-recommended
general-purpose implementation, including deliberately optimized software
emulation beyond native width. Exact profile selection, cost metadata, and
relational pair generation remain CPU-provider/generic work.

## Multiword operations

The operator catalog records these as accepted concepts with exact words
deferred:

```zax
// Illustrative wording; exact multiword phrases are not established.
high shift left through low by count
high rotate left through low by count
result funnel right from high and low by count
```

Exact spellings stay deferred because arithmetic versus logical right shift,
receiver orientation, high/low ordering, result shape, multi-place mutation,
signedness, and aliasing all affect the theoretical prototypes. Future numeric
work must settle:

- whether components must share one logical bit extent;
- whether a writable form mutates one place or several;
- what a funnel shift's fixed-width result window is; and
- how aliasing among component places behaves.

## Reversal and masked extraction/deposit

Bit reversal and byte reversal are distinct finite-extent concepts: byte reversal
preserves bit order within each byte, while bit reversal does not.

Masked extraction packs every source bit selected by a mask into contiguous
low-order positions. Masked deposit scatters contiguous low-order input bits into
positions selected by a mask.

Future numeric work must decide exact words, mask-width behavior, zero fill,
signedness interaction, and unsupported-target costs.

## Aliases

Transparent aliases and explicit identity types are now distinguished by
[Zax identity types](../../language/identity-types.md). Future numeric work
retains only generic alias generation and identity-aware associated-type
questions.

Legacy intrinsic input also proposed `UUID` as an alias of `U128` and `Rune` as
an alias of a wide character integer. Current design does not retain those
transparent integer aliases. Future UUID and Unicode-scalar work must decide
their independent identity, validity, formatting, conversion, and operation
surfaces without inheriting arithmetic merely from storage.

## Numeric interaction with enums

An enum is backed by one fundamental intrinsic type but is an independent type.
It receives no automatic integer arithmetic merely from that backing. Whether a
future flag or another enum kind explicitly requests selected bitwise, reduction,
shift, magnitude, or signedness behavior remains an *enum* question preserved in
[raw enum input](enum-types.md).

Numeric work should consult that file when a numeric decision would constrain
enum behavior, and vice versa. This file no longer holds enum-specific questions.

## Floating representation

Floating numeric operations and raw representation access are separate:

```zax
// Illustrative future concept.
bits of floatValue
```

Future work must distinguish numeric conversion, bit-preserving reinterpretation,
unsafe raw access, NaN payloads, canonicalization, byte order, and target
representation. Ordinary float bitwise operators remain reserved and unavailable
until that review.

## Activation and retirement

Activate this input for numeric types, generic numeric contracts, signedness,
fixed-point, arbitrary-width, count and associated types, conversion,
delta/distance, multiword operations, reversal, masked extraction/deposit,
alias, float, or representation work. Move accepted behavior into numeric,
type, cast, generic, or operator owners and retire this file after every item is
dispositioned. Enum-specific questions are dispositioned through
[raw enum input](enum-types.md) instead.
