## Start with a lambda

A lambda combines captured state with a callable body:

```zax
factor := 3

scale := [[ factor ]] (
  result : Integer
)(
  input : Integer
) {
  return input * factor
}

factor = 4
scaled := scale(5) // 15
```

Constructing `scale` copies `factor` into a generated receiver. Calling `scale`
later runs the body against that retained receiver; it does not capture
`factor` again.

The declaration and lambda expression have separate roles:

```text
scale :=                         declare and initialize scale
[[ factor ]]                    construct its capture receiver
(result : Integer)(input : ...) state its call prototype
{ ... }                         define its delayed body
```

An empty capture is explicit:

```zax
doubleLater := [[]] (
  result : Integer
)(
  input : Integer
) {
  return input * 2
}
```

`[[]]` says that this is a lambda with zero captures. A nonempty single-line
capture uses interior spaces, as in `[[ factor ]]`; multiline captures place the
entries on indented lines. Complete token and spacing rules are in
[source structure](source-structure.md#array-expressions-capture-delimiters-and-slicing).

### Lambdas may declare exceptional outcomes

A lambda uses the same completion contract as a named function:

```zax
reader := [[ source ]] (
  value : MyValue,
  failure except : MyFailure
)() {
  if cannotRead(source)
    except failure: makeFailure(source)

  return readValue(source)
}
```

The exceptional outcome is part of the minted callable prototype. Invocation,
storage, catch, forwarding, outcome reshape, and composition preserve it under
ordinary callable rules.

Selecting `failure` ends one invocation. It does not destroy or reset `reader`
or its capture receiver. A reference exceptional payload projected from
captured state retains that capture origin and cannot outlive the receiver
relationship that keeps it valid.

## Capture values, references, and producer results

### Ordinary capture copies

Each ordinary capture constructs a value in the generated receiver:

```zax
message := "ready"

report := [[ message ]] ()() {
  print(message)
}

message = "changed"
report() // prints ready
```

The default is `copy`. If the source name is a reference, ordinary capture
copies the referent rather than preserving the reference:

```zax
source : Document
view : Document readonly & = source

snapshot := [[ view ]] ()() {
  inspect(view) // a captured Document value
}
```

If the referent cannot be copied, this capture is unavailable.

### Rename or construct a capture

Capture mapping reads from source to destination:

```zax
sourceCount : Integer = 42

report := [[ sourceCount: capturedCount: ]] ()() {
  print(capturedCount)
}
```

A complete destination declaration requests direct construction:

```zax
report := [[ sourceCount: capturedCount : MyCount ]] ()() {
  print(capturedCount)
}
```

Construction happens when `report` is created. It may invoke user code,
allocate, or panic like the equivalent ordinary typed declaration.

An empty destination name retains the source name:

```zax
report := [[ sourceCount: : MyCount ]] ()() {
  print(sourceCount)
}
```

A `#` destination stores the capture and introduces no body name:

```zax
keeper := [[
  source: # : StoredResource,
  visible: kept:
]] ()() {
  use(kept)
}
```

`source` is constructed as `StoredResource` when `keeper` is created and
destroyed with `keeper`'s receiver. The body cannot name it. `source: #`
without a type copies the source the same way and likewise introduces no name.
The empty-name form above is different: `sourceCount: : MyCount` still binds
`sourceCount`.

The bare destination name and the receiver member are the same capture:

```zax
report := [[ sourceCount: capturedCount: ]] ()() {
  print(capturedCount)
  print(_.capturedCount)
}
```

The capture list inserts `capturedCount` as a body binding for that receiver
member. A read of either spelling uses the capture. A `#` destination has no
member name, so the discarded `source` above has no `_.source`.

### Explicit reference capture borrows

```zax
total := 0

accumulate := [[ total: capturedTotal : & ]] ()(
  delta : Integer
) {
  capturedTotal += delta
}

accumulate(5)
print(total) // 5
```

`capturedTotal` is another reference bound to `total`'s fixed place. It owns
nothing, never rebinds, and cannot outlive that place. Qualification and
declaration-side replacement permissions cannot become stronger through
capture.

Reference capture does not inherit `unsafe pliable` or a destructive declaration
stance. A capture that deliberately needs either must state its own applicable
source.

### Source stance and capture stance are separate

A source expression can state how lambda construction consumes it:

```zax
callback := [[ value as last: myValue ]] ()() bound strong {
  use(myValue)
}
```

`value as last` is a one-use offer for construction of `myValue`. It does not
make later body uses terminal automatically.

The completed capture declaration may state its own future stance:

```zax
callback := [[
  value as last: myValue : MyType move
]] ()() bound strong {
  consume(myValue)
}
```

Here the outer source offers `last` during capture construction, while ordinary
body use of `myValue` offers `move`. A source-relative `anchor` may likewise
select the captured region under the ordinary structural rules.

### Capture producer results once

```zax
report := [[
  count: capturedCount:,
  text: capturedText: = makeReportInputs()
]] ()() {
  print(capturedCount, capturedText)
}
```

`makeReportInputs()` runs once while `report` is constructed. Its results map to
capture declarations through the ordinary source-to-destination routing rules.

Capture expressions and producer groups evaluate in source order and bind
immediately. The body becomes callable only after every required capture is
complete. Owned captures are dispositioned in reverse construction order when
their generated receiver ends.

## Callable prototypes and storage

Four independent choices describe a callable:

1. Its prototype states explicit results, inputs, labels, defaults,
   qualifications, and transfer stances.
2. A `bound` implementation has a receiver available through `_`; an `unbound`
   implementation does not.
3. A `final` declaration fixes one implementation; a `varying` declaration
   provides replaceable callable storage.
4. Receiver-capable storage may borrow or retain receiver lifetime through
   `unique`, `strong`, `strong atomic`, `weak`, or `weak atomic`.

Receiver-lifetime words require `bound`: an unbound implementation has no
receiver lifetime to retain.

A callback is a callable used through a parameter or stored value rather than a
separate callable category. Its visible prototype includes every ordinary and
exceptional result:

- every installed callback implementation must satisfy that outcome contract;
- the invoker handles or forwards outcomes at the callback call site;
- an implementation with additional outcomes cannot enter a slot that omits
  them; and
- a wrapper lambda may handle or reshape outcomes to expose another explicit
  callback contract.

Runtime callback selection therefore performs no handler discovery. The static
prototype already determines every possible completion outcome.

### Fixed and varying examples

```zax
MyType :: type {
  value : Integer

  fixed final : ()() bound = {
    ++_.value
  }

  receiverless final : ()() unbound = {
    // `_` is unavailable.
  }

  typeAndInstance final once : ()() bound = {
    if ?_
      ++_.value
  }

  replaceable : ()() bound = {
    ++_.value
  }

  retaining : ()() bound strong = {
    ++_.value
  }
}
```

`fixed` has one implementation and no replaceable per-instance slot.
`receiverless` is owned by `MyType` but receives no instance.
`typeAndInstance` supports an ordinary instance call and a receiverless type
call through the type's Nothing instance.

`replaceable` stores an implementation and, when that implementation is bound,
its receiver. Assignment may install a compatible implementation whose receiver
has another concrete type:

```zax
left : MyType
right : OtherType

left.replaceable = right.otherFunc
left.replaceable()
// `_` inside OtherType.otherFunc is right.
```

`left` locates the slot; it does not replace the receiver stored in that slot.
The receiver's type belongs to the minted implementation and is erased from the
visible compatible prototype.

For new direct storage, declaration-side `final` also resolves the omitted
type-side place stance to final. A final and varying callable therefore have
different resolved storage types even when their explicit input/result
prototype looks the same.

### Storage capacity and installed target

A receiver-capable slot can hold a target requiring no receiver:

- unbound storage accepts unbound targets;
- plain bound storage also accepts borrowed-bound targets;
- `bound unique` additionally accepts a uniquely owned receiver;
- `bound strong` and `bound strong atomic` additionally accept the corresponding
  shared receiver; and
- `bound weak` and `bound weak atomic` additionally accept weak observation.

The capacity does not force every target to use it. An unbound target remains
unbound; a borrowed target remains borrowed; assigning a strong target into a
weak slot establishes a weak observation rather than retaining strong ownership.

## Lambda receivers and receiver lifetime

A capturing lambda constructs one anonymous receiver containing its captures.
Different lambda definitions retain distinct language identities even when
their capture layouts happen to match.

Representative forms are:

```zax
plain := [[]] ()() unbound {
  performWork()
}

recursive := [[]] ()(
  value : Integer
) bound {
  if value > 0
    _(value - 1)
}

localCapture := [[ value ]] ()() {
  use(value)
}

borrowed : ()() bound = localCapture

uniqueCallback := [[ value ]] ()() bound unique {
  use(value)
}

sharedCallback := [[ value ]] ()() bound strong {
  use(value)
}

atomicCallback := [[ value ]] ()() bound strong atomic @{ myArena } {
  use(value)
}

observer : ()() bound weak = sharedCallback
```

A noncapturing lambda may be unbound. It may instead be bound when it needs its
self receiver, including recursion through `_(...)`. Capturing necessarily
creates a generated bound receiver.

Plain `bound` erasure borrows `localCapture`; its lifetime must remain valid.
Owned forms continue the receiver in arena-backed storage. Omitted allocation
policy uses the applicable default arena; `@{...}` states nondefault policy.

`atomic` changes ownership accounting, not data-race safety of the receiver.

### Inherit a complete prototype

An explicit callable destination can supply the complete lambda prototype:

```zax
MyCallback :: alias type ()() bound strong

callback : MyCallback = [[ value ]] {
  use(value)
}
```

Prototype inheritance is all-or-nothing. The destination supplies results,
inputs, labels, defaults, qualifications, binding category, and lifetime
capacity together. An inferred declaration writes the complete prototype.

An inherited parameter is in scope even though this lambda did not write it.
Leaving it unread is the same intent error as any other unread name. Acknowledge
it with the trailing marker:

```zax
MyHandler :: alias type ()(
  value : Integer
) bound strong

handler : MyHandler = [[]] {
  value #
}
```

`value #` does not declare `value`. The declaration rule is taught by
[declarations and bindings](declarations-and-bindings.md#names-the-body-may-leave-unread).

A `>>` target may similarly supply the complete remaining prototype when target
selection is unambiguous.

## Presence, liveness, and installed binding kind

`?callback` asks whether an implementation is assigned. It does not ask whether
an assigned weak receiver can currently be promoted:

```zax
assigned := ?callback
liveNow := liveness probe callback
```

`liveness probe` returns `Boolean`, performs no acquisition, and grants no
lifetime proof. It is true for assigned unbound, borrowed, unique, and strong
targets. For an installed weak target, it reports whether strong ownership is
open at that instant. The answer may become stale immediately.

| Installed binding | `liveness probe` |
| --- | --- |
| Unavailable | `false` |
| Unbound | `true` |
| Bound borrowed | `true` |
| Bound unique | `true` |
| Bound strong | `true` |
| Bound strong atomic | `true` |
| Bound weak | Whether strong ownership is open at this instant |
| Bound weak atomic | Whether strong ownership is open at this instant |

Actual weak-to-strong construction is the operation that pins a receiver.

One query reports the installed mode:

```zax
kind := binding kind of callback
```

The result is a language-provided enum:

```zax
// `Callables` is provisional library placement; the enum surface is current.
Callables.BindingKind :: enum {
  Unavailable
  Unbound
  Bound
  BoundUnique
  BoundStrong
  BoundStrongAtomic
  BoundWeak
  BoundWeakAtomic
}
```

`Bound` is the borrowed/nonowning bound mode. The query reports the installed
target rather than the slot's maximum static capacity. The enum's canonical
namespace and any root alias remain deferred library-surface placement.

### Weak invocation is conditionally empty

A `bound weak` callable permits only a truly empty result contract: no ordinary
results and no exceptional results. An `except` result is a result and therefore
makes weak storage unavailable. A valid zero-result weak callable never panics
merely because its slot or observed receiver is unavailable.

Invocation keeps ordinary caller-side setup:

1. evaluate the callable expression;
2. evaluate explicit arguments in source order and bind them;
3. evaluate visible-prototype defaults for omitted inputs;
4. inspect the installed binding;
5. invoke an installed unbound or borrowed target normally;
6. temporarily promote an installed weak target and invoke it on success; or
7. complete as a no-op when the slot is unavailable or weak promotion fails.

Argument effects, defaults, construction, temporary lifetimes, and destruction
still occur when no body runs. This makes absence change only body invocation,
not caller-side evaluation.

No ordinary or exceptional result can be manufactured, so every resultful weak
callable prototype is unavailable. `?callback` remains false for an unavailable
slot and true when any target is assigned; callers need not guard a valid
zero-result weak invocation merely to avoid panic.

## Callable transfer, reset, and recursion

Capture expressions run only during construction. Callable transfer never
recaptures:

- `copy` copies the receiver/lifetime relationship;
- a borrowed copy remains another borrow;
- a strong copy adds participation in the same receiver lifetime;
- a weak copy adds another weak observation;
- unique ownership cannot be copied;
- `move` and `last` transfer the relationship and leave the source initialized
  but unavailable without releasing what moved away; and
- callable `deep` is undefined.

Reset dispositions the active target and restores unavailable state:

- unbound clears its implementation;
- borrowed clears only the borrow;
- unique releases the owned receiver;
- strong releases one participation;
- strong atomic releases atomically; and
- weak releases the observation, never the target.

Replacing a varying slot constructs the new callable first, dispositions the
old target, and publishes one complete successor. A panic leaves replacement or
reset as the blocked operation; it does not expose a half-updated slot.

### Repeated destructive capture use

Invocation leaves the callable alive. A capture consumed by `move` remains
moved-from; a capture consumed by `last` remains terminal. Static analysis
diagnoses later body operations invalid for that state.

Zax does not add a one-shot or self-resetting lambda mode. A programmer may
invoke and explicitly reset a slot. A later generic/reflection abstraction can
provide fire-once policy when an application needs it.

### Self-recursion uses the lambda receiver

```zax
countDown := [[]] ()(
  value : Integer
) bound {
  if value > 0
    _(value - 1)
}
```

`_(...)` calls this receiver and its minted implementation. The parentheses are
the call, as in `myValue(...)`. The dot is member access, as in
`_.capturedCount`, not part of the call. Replacing a slot
through which this lambda was reached does not redirect self-recursion. An
unbound lambda has no `_`.

## Capture a member callable

A member expression already carries its receiver:

```zax
counter : Counter

readCounter := [[]] >> counter.read
current := readCounter()
```

The empty capture says that no additional values or ordinary inputs are bound.
`counter.read` supplies the receiver and prototype. A qualified declaration path
may participate in lookup and `type of`, but Zax has no runtime callable value
that merely waits for a receiver to be reattached.

## Partial application

`>>` can bind selected ordinary inputs without invoking the target:

```zax
printPair final : ()(
  number : Integer,
  text : String
) unbound = {
  print(number, text)
}

number := 42

printNumberWith := [[ number: number: ]] ()(
  remainingText : String
) >> printPair

printNumberWith("apples")
```

Construction binds `number` once. The written prototype renames the remaining
input. When no visible change is needed, the target supplies it:

```zax
printNumberWith := [[ number: number: ]] >> printPair
```

Target defaults remain delayed until the generated callable is invoked unless a
value is explicitly captured now.

## Compose functions for later use

Compatible callables compose positionally:

```zax
parse final : (
  parsed : Parsed
)(
  source : String
) unbound = {
}

render final : (
  text : String
)(
  parsed : Parsed
) unbound = {
}

parseThenRender := parse >> render
text := parseThenRender(sourceText)
```

Constructing `parseThenRender` calls neither function. Each invocation calls
`parse`, maps its result into `render`, calls `render`, and exposes the final
result. Several results remain separate slots.

### Remap with `reshape`

```zax
ParseToRender :: reshape {
  tree: document:
  notes: diagnostics:
}

parseThenRender := parse >> ParseToRender >> render
```

The three-part source is one composition operation; the reshape is not invoked
and creates no intermediate aggregate. Mapping proceeds deterministically:

1. apply explicit reshape entries;
2. match remaining equal labels;
3. map remaining slots positionally;
4. apply destination defaults and source-result omission policy; and
5. never backtrack.

An incompatible equal-label pair is an error rather than a reason to guess
another positional mapping.

### Exceptional outcomes in retained composition

`>>` exposes the union of its stages' exceptional outcomes. A later stage runs
only after every prior stage selected success:

```zax
pipeline := parse >> render
```

If `parse` selects an exceptional outcome, `render` is not invoked. Calling
`pipeline` must handle or forward that parse outcome. An exceptional outcome
from `render` remains independently exposed.

A retained callable prototype requires unique exceptional labels. Reshape a
collision before composition:

```zax
ParseFailureNames :: reshape {
  failure: parseFailure:
}

renamedParse := parse reshape ParseFailureNames
pipeline := renamedParse >> render
```

Applying the reshape adapts `parse`'s visible outcome label without invoking it.
The composed callable preserves payload type, qualifications, transfer stance,
origin, and ordinary-versus-exceptional category. It never merges same-typed
failures or chooses a destination by type.

Complete outcome production, catch, forwarding, and conditional elision are
taught by [Zax exceptional result flow](except.md).

## Chain calls immediately

`|>` performs calls now:

```zax
result := 5 |> double() |> square() |> half()
```

It evaluates the carried source once, maps it to the next call, completes that
call, and advances with its result. `>>` instead constructs a retained callable
for later invocation.

Named and several-result chaining use the same explicit routing principles as
composition.

Each reached stage's exceptional outcomes remain exposed to a trailing handler.
An exceptional stage skips every later stage. Equal-label stage outcomes may
share one branch-specialized catch at that immediate use or be distinguished by
outcome reshape:

```zax
result := source |>
  parse() reshape failure: parseFailure: |>
  render() catch parseFailure {
    return
  } catch failure {
    return
  }
```

## Optional callable values

Optional absence and callable unavailability remain distinct:

```zax
outerAbsent : MyCallback?
presentUnavailable : MyCallback? = (: MyCallback)
presentCallable : MyCallback? = callback
```

Resetting the boxed callable restores inner unavailability. Resetting the
optional ends the boxed callable lifetime and leaves outer absence.

## Costs and diagnostics

Programmers and tools must expose:

- capture evaluation, construction, and destruction order;
- copies, conversions, borrows, moves, and terminal transfers;
- direct versus indirect calls;
- receiver and erased-destructor storage;
- arena allocation and policy;
- unique/strong/weak and local/atomic accounting;
- liveness probes and weak promotion;
- composition call sequence and mapping;
- retained outcome sets, exceptional-label reshape, and skipped later stages;
- reset/replacement work and panic paths; and
- static lifetime, origin, transfer, and repeated-state analysis.

Diagnostics should distinguish:

- malformed capture presentation;
- unavailable capture copy;
- reference escape;
- binding or storage mismatch;
- missing ownership capacity;
- an unread capture name, unless a `#` destination stored it without a name or
  the body read the bare name or `_.name`;
- resultful weak storage;
- failed composition mapping;
- repeated invalid capture use;
- unavailable invocation;
- ineligible reset;
- colliding retained exceptional labels; and
- outcome reshape that changes result category or cannot find its source.

## Boundaries and maturity

This document is current conceptual design, not a formal grammar, ABI,
implementation mapping, or conformance contract.

Still deferred:

- generic lambda parameters, constraints, and specialization;
- complete variadic composition;
- async suspension and cancellation;
- foreign callable ABI and dynamic linking;
- canonical namespace placement for callable metadata;
- reflection schemas;
- optional callback combinator naming;
- one-shot library abstractions; and
- closure layout, control blocks, optimization, and lowering.
